    "text": "2.1 Why are coastal landscapes different and what processes cause these differences?\n\n2.1.1 The Littoral Zone\n\nThis is the area between the land and the sea, stretching out into the sea and onto the shore.\nThe zone is subdivided into the backshore, foreshore, nearshore and offshore\nThe backshore is only affected by waves during high tides (often called spring tides) and during major storms. It is above sea level. This is where mass movement and weathering occurs\nThe nearshore refers to shallow water close to land. It is very there is most human activity, such as fishing and and leisure\nWaves processes normally occur between the high and low tide mark. Erosion and deposition occur at the foreshore and nearshore.\n\nThe zone is in dynamic equilibrium due to the wide range of natural processes that interact within it These process can be short term (individual waves, tides etc) or long term (climate change)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInputs\nProcess\nOutput\n\n\n\nSediment from the sea and currents from rivers flowing off the land\nHuman activity (e.g. dredging of offshore areas to get sand and gravel for construction\n\n\nErosion\nDeposition\nWeathering\nTransport\n\n\nDifferent  types of coasts - sandy beaches, wetlands\nDepositional landforms - spits, tombolo\nErosional landforms - arch, stack, stump\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Classifying coasts\nCoasts can be classified using longer term criteria such as geology, sea level rise as well as shorter term processes such as inputs from rivers, waves and tides - erosion and deposition which cause short term changes.\n\n\n2.1.3 High and Low energy coasts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCol1\nLow Energy Coasts\nHigh energy coasts\n\n\n\n\nWaves\n\nConstructive waves\nCalmer conditions\nShort fetch\n\n\nDestructive waves\nStorm conditions\nLong fetch\n\n\n\nProcesses\n\nDeposition and transport\nSediments from rivers, longshore drift and nearshore currents\n\n\nErosion and transport\nSediments from eroded land, mass movement and weathering\n\n\n\nLandforms\n\nBeach, spits, salt marshes, sand dunes, bars\n\n\nCliffs, wave cut platforms, arches, sea caves\n\n\n\nGeneral location\n\nCoastal plain landscape\nLowland coast\n\n\nHighland and lowland coasts\nRocky landscape\n\n\n\n\nThere are two main types of coasts\n\nRocky coastlines - with cliffs varying in height from a  few meters to hundreds of meters\n\nCliffed coast\n\nThe transition from sea to land is abrupt\nAt low tide the foreshore zone is exposed as a wave cut platform\n\n\nCoastal Plains - land slopes towards the sea across an area of deposited sediment\n\nEstuarine coastline\n\nEstuarine are found at the mouths of rivers\nExtensive mudflats are exposed at low tide.\nCloser to the backshore the mudflats are vegetated\nDeposition of sediment from the land brought down to the coast by river systems can cause coastal accretion where the coastline moves seawards (e.g. through river deltas)\n\nSandy coastline\n\nSand dunes fringe many coastal plains\nDune stabilisation plays critical role in stabilising the coast and preventing erosion\nSome are  a result of a fall in sea level exposing the seabed of what was once a shallow continental shelf sea\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Concordant and discordant coastlines\nThe shape of a coastline is largely determined by geology and wave action.\nConcordant Coastline (Pacific coasts)\n\nRock types lie in the same direction as the coastline - e.g. in South Dorset made from purbeck limestone, mudstone, greensand etc.\nDalmatian Coastlines\n\nThe geology of Dalmatia is limestone, \nIt has been folded by tectonic activity into a series of anticlines and synclines that trend parallel to the moden coastline\nThese basins have been drowned by rising sea levels of create a concordant coastline of long, narrow islands arranged in lines offshore\n\nHaff Coastline\n\nLong sediment ridges topped by sand dunes run parallel to the coast just offshore, creating lagoons (haffs) between the ridge and the shore\n\n\nDiscordant Coastline (Atlantic Coasts)\n\nRock types is perpendicular to the coast\nAlternating bands of hard and soft rock create headlands where there is more resistant rock (or an upfold) and bays (downfalls) where there is less resistant rock\nBays have semicircular shapes; as the waves enter the bay, the waves dissipate, lose energy and deposit a bay head beach.\nHeadlands protrude out into the sea\n\nThe shape of a coastline causes wave to refract as they approach the headlands\nAs waves approach the shallower water offshore a headland, they slow down and wave height increases\nand this concentrates the waves energy on a headland. \n\nE.g. on the East Dorset Coastline, a bay has formed called Swanage Bay as the mudstone has eroded quicker than the purbeck limestone and and chalk, leading to headlands e.g. studland head\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Coastal Geomorphology\nGeological structures can influence on coastal morphology and erosion rates\n\nCliff profiles are influenced by different aspects of geology, namely\n\n\nThe resistance erosion of the rock\n\nThere are two main cliff profile types: maine erosion dominated or subaerial process dominated\n\nAt maine erosion dominated cliffs, wave action dominates, cliffs tend to be steep. There is little in the way of rock debris at the base of the cliff as its quickly broken up by erosion and carried away by waves\nAt subaerial dominated cliffs, mass movement and surface runoff erosion dominates. They slowly move rock and sediment downslope by the limited marine wave erosion means it’s not removed.\n\n\nThe dip of rock strata in relation to the coastline\nThe dip simply refers to the angle of the rock strata in relation to the horizontal\nThe angle can be tilted by tectonic activity\nThere are four main types: \n\nHorizontal - vertical profile with notches reflect strata that are more easily eroded\nSeaward dip, high angle - one rock layer faces the sea\nSeaward dip low angle - profile may exceed 90 degrees producing areas of overhanging rock, very vulnerable to rock falls\nLandward dip - Very stable cliff with reduced rock falls\n\n\nFaults represent weaknesses within rock layers. They are major fractures due to tectonic activity. Either side of a fault tines, rocks are fractures and broken and these weakness can be exploited by marine erosion\nJoints occur at the division of rock strata up into blocks with a regular shape\nFissures are smaller cracks in rocks, often a few cm or mm long but the represent weakness that erosion can exploit\nCaves and wave cut notches occur at the location of faults, and or strata which have a high density of joints and fissures.\n\nRegular patterns of joining in rocks are often a result of sedimentary rocks being folded by tectonic forces.\nFolding occurs due to crustal compression. When horizontal stars are squeezed they can be folded into a series of anticlines and synclines. \n\n\n\n2.1.6 Differential Erosion rates\nBedrock Lithology\n\nIgneous\n\nE.g. Granite; basalt\nVery slow erosion rate\nIgneous rocks are crystalline - i.e. the interlocking crystals make for strong hard erosion- resistant rock\nThere are few joints (e.g. granite) so there are limited weaknesses than erosion can exploit\n\nMetamorphic\n\nE..g marble\nSlow erosion rate\nCrystalline metamorphic rock are resistant to erosion\nHowever, sometimes the crystals are oriented in one direction, producing weaknesses - called foliation\nMetamorphic rocks are often folded and heavily fractured which are weaknesses the erosion can exploit\n\nSedimentary\n\nSandstone; limestone\nModerate to fast\nTend to be clastic - i.e. made of cemented sediment particles\nThe age of sedimentary rock is important as geologically young rocks tend to be weaker\nRocks with many fractures, such as shale are often most vulnerable to erosion\n\n\nThe weakest coastal material is unconsolidated sediment. E..g sand, gravel clay, that have not been compacted or cemented to become sedimentary rock. It is loose and easily eroded\nPermeability\n\nPermeable rocks allow water to flow through them - e.g sandstone, limestone\nImpermeable rocks do not allow water to flow through them including most igneous and metamorphic rocks\nThis is important as water can remove the cement that holds the rock together\nIt can also create high pore water pressure within cliffs, affecting their stability (leads to rotational slumping)\nSome type of rock contain soluble minerals, and so are vulnerable to chemical weathering such as carbonation or hydrolysis\n\nThe role of vegetation at the coast\n\nEcosystems at the coast include coral reefs, mangrove forests, salt marshes and sand dunes\nSalt marshes and sand dunes are the most common in lowland UK areas\nMost plants that grow in coastal environments are:\nHalophytes - tolerate salt water\nXerophytes - Tolerate very dry conditions\nSalt Marshes successional development in eustraline areas\n\nCommon in low energy environments of estuaries and sheltered bays\nThe river brings in fine muds and silts, depositing them at the sides of the estuaries whilst the tidal conditions bring seawater in and out\nThe tiny clay particles stick to each other, in a process called flocculation, and once deposited they are colonised by algae\nOver time, the plants trap more sediment which builds up the salt mash up to a higher level so that other plants can then colonise.\n\nSand dunes successional development on sandy coastlines\n\nForm when there is plentiful supply of sand, a large area of the sand to dry out, strong onshore winds to blow the sand towards the land and an obstacle such as vegetation to trap the sand. \nEmbryo dunes form first and once established collect more sand and become larger\nPioneer plants (eg sea rocket) colonse the stable dunes and help hold the sand together and trap more sand\nYellow dunes are highest and are colonised by marram grass.\nSlacks form (dips in the succession) due to periods of wind erosions\nAt high tide, seawater may reach the dips in the sand dunes, called slacks, allowing other plants such as marsh orchids to grow here.\nMature dunes (also known as grey dunes) contain high humus content.\nThe oldest dunes are closest to the land - the climax vegetation is either pine forests or oak forests\n\n\nHow does vegetation stabilise sediment?\n\nRoots of the sediment help bind particles together, making them harder to erode\nPlants act as  protective layer so the surface of the sediment is not directly exposed to move water and thus erosion\nReduce wind speed at the surface due to friction  with the vegetation, reducing wind erosion"

    "text": "2.2 How do characteristic coastal landforms contribute to coastal landscapes?\n\n2.2.1 Wave size depends on:\n\nStrength of wind\nThe fetch (distance wind has blown over)\nWater depth\nDuration the wind blows for\n\nAs waves approach a shoreline, the internal orbital motion of water touches the seabed, causing friction between the wave and the seabed, slowing down the wave. ITs wavelength decreases and wave height increases. It breaks in shallow water as the crest of the wave begins to move forward much faster than the trough as the trough experiences more friction with the sediment and the rock of the shore. The crest outruns the trough and the wave topples forward\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstructive\nDestructive\n\n\n\nLow wave height\nLong wavelength - over 100m (so low frequency)\nGentle flat waves with a strong swash but weak backwash\nSwash pushes sediment up the beach, leading to deposition\nRelatively gentle beach profile\n\n\nHigh wave height (over 1m)\nShorter) wavelength (20m)\nWaves have strong backwash and erodes beach materia and carries it offshore, creating an offshore ridge or bar\n\n\n\n\nIn summer constructive waves dominate; in winter, destructive waves dominate\nA beach profile may change as destructive waves give way to constructive waves after a storm parsses\nOver long periods, beach profiles may change\n\nSediment supply from a river is reduced perhaps due to the construction of dams on rivers that trap sediment upstream\nCoastal management in one place may alter processes further along the coast\nIf global warming made the UK climate stormier, than destructive waves would become more common\n\nErosional Processes\n\nCorrasion - or abrasion occurs when the sediment picked up by waves is thrown against the cliff face. This chisels away the surface and gradually wears it down as it abrades (or scratches) the rock. \n\nLoose sediment has to be available (for example shingle, or pebbles)\nSofter sedimentary rocks are more vulnerable than hard igneous rocks\n\nAttrition - When boulders, rock particles, pebbles are continually moved around the waves, they collide with each other. The numerous collisions between particles slowly chip fragments of the sediment. The sediment becomes smoother, smaller and more rounded over time\n\nProcess is faster with softer rocks\n\nSolution - or corrosion occurs when carbonate rocks are vulnerable to solution by rainwater, spray from the sea or seawater \n\nMainly affects limestone, which is vulnerable to solution by weak acids\n\nHydraulic Action - Air trapped in cracks and fissures is compressed by the force of destructive waves crashing against the cliff face. As the wave retreats, pressure forces the crack open. This process dislodges blocks of rock from the cliff face\n\nHighly jointed/fissured sedimentary rocks are very vulnerable\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Erosional landforms\nWave cut notches\n\nAt high tide, destructive waves reach the base of the cliff\nThrough corrosion and hydraulic action, wear away the fock\nA curved, wave cut notch forms\n\nWave cut platforms\n\nAs the cliff is eroded at the base, the rock above is left unsupported leaving an overhang. This collapses under the influence of gravity.\nAs the cliff retreats, a wave cut platform is left behind between the high and low tide levels.\n\nCliffs\n\nCliffs are vertical slopes caused by waves undercutting the land at high tide.\nAs the cliffs are undercut, gravity is able to cause mass movement in the unsupported rock\n\nCave- Arch- stack-stump sequence\n\nAt a headland waves will be refracted so that the full energy of erosion is concentrated on weakness on the sides\nHydraulic action and corrasion will form a cave. E.g. Tilly Whim Cave\nWhen these meet from opposite sides, a tunnel is formed called a rock arch - e.g Durdle Door\nEventually the top becomes unstable, and collapses, leaving a pillar of rock called a stack. E.g. Old Harry Rock\nWAves can continue to erode the base of a stack (especially during storm conditions) cutting notches in several sides.\nThe stack becomes unstable and collapses, leaving just the base called a stump e.g Old Harry’s Wife\nWaves, tides and currents can transport sediment. For example rip currents, transport sediment from the foreshore to nearshore areas\nTide also determines what height on the foreshore  or backfshore these processes may be operating.\nThe main transport process is longshore drift\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Longshore Drift\n\nPrevailing wind may be an oblique angle.\nThus the waves approach the coast at an oblique angle (the strongest drift occurs at an angle of 30 degrees)\nThe swash moves beach sediment up the beach at the same angle as the wave approach\nUnder the influence of gravity, the backwash brings the sediment back down at a right angle to the shore. \nOver time, the sediment zigzags along the beach \n\n\n\n2.2.4 Processes of sediment transport\n\n\n\nTraction - Pebbles, boulders etc rolls along, pushed by waves\nSaltation - sand sized particles bounches along, due to wind or force of water\nSediment (such as  silt and clay) is carried in the water column looking murky\nSolution - dissolved material is carried in the water as a solution\n\n\n\n2.2.5 Depositional Landforms\nCoasts can be divided into two broad categories\n\nSwash aligned coasts - Wave crescents approach parallel to the coast, so there is limited longshore movement of sediment\nDrift aligned coasts - Waves crests break at an angle to the coast, so there is consistent longshore drift and the generation of elongated depositional features\n\nLongshore drift as well as sediment from a river are key sources of sediment for depositional landforms on coasts.\nDeposition occurs due to:\n\nGravity Settling - The energy of the transporting water becomes too low to move sediment\nFlocculation - Particles (e.g. of clay) clump together due to electric or chemical attraction and becomes large enough to sink\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLandform\nProcesses\nExample\n\n\nBayhead Beach\n\nSwash aligned feature where waves break and move sediment into a bay where a beach forms.\nDue to wave refraction, erosion is concentrated on the headland and the bay is an area of deposition\n\nLulworth Cove, Dorset\n\n\nSpits (Recurved and double)\n\nLongshore drift carries sediment along a beach\nAs the coast changes direction, due to an estuary or bay, the longshore drift current loses energy leading to deposition\nEventually salt tolerant plants grow in this area to form mudflats and a salt marsh\nA curved spit end is curved landward into a bay. This occurs when there is a change in wind direction as well as tides and river currents moving in and out of the estuary\nA double split occurs when two spits have not joined to form a bar or cuspate foreland, because several rivers discharge their flows into the sea.\n\nSpurn head\n\n\nOffshore Bars\n\nLong ride of sand and pebbles found a short distance out to sea\nIt forms in shallow water, where destructive waves break before reaching the beach. This results in deposition of sand\n\n\n\n\nBarrier beaches and bars\n\nA spit can grow so long that it extends across a bay. Behind the bar, there is a shallower water lagoon behind.\nNearshore bars are similar to barrier beaches but smaller.\n\n\n\n\nTombolo\n\nA sand or shingle bar that attaches the coastline to an offshore island.\nWave refraction around  an offshore island creates an area of calm water and deposition between the coast and the island can occur\n\nSt Ninians tombolo, Shetland\n\n\nCuspate Foreland\n\nGrowth of two spits from opposing longshore drift directions cause a triangular shaped feature which extends out from a shoreline\nCoastal deposition and alluvial deposits from small streams flowing into the bay because the area to fill up with sediment\nMudflats and saltmarshes form and the deposition will eventually be enough to form a new area of lowland\n\nDungeness, Kent\n\n\n\nPlant succession is very important as they bind the loose sediment together and encourage further deposition. Sand dunes stabilize the sediment landward of the beach. Depositional landforms are thus vulnerable when their generation is damaged. This happens due to overgrazing or trampling from tourism and leisure activities\n\n\n2.2.6 The sediment cell model\n\nLong stretches of coastline operate as sediment cells\nEach cell can be regarded as a closed system\nThere are 11 of these around the English and Welsh coastline\nIn each cell:\n\nSources - places where the sediment is generated e.g. at cliffs. Some sources can be offshore bars. River systems can also act as important source of sediment for the coast\nTransfer zones - places where the sediment is moving along the shore through longshore drift and offshore currents\nSinks - Locations where deposition is occuring. Landforms such as spits and offshore bars are created.\n\nThe system acts in a state of dynamic equilibrium with sediment inputs balancing the outputs to sinks\nNegative feedback mechanism maintain the balance by pushing the system back to equilibrium (e.g. after  as form where erosion may dominate) \n\nMajor erosion of sand dunes could lead to excessive deposition offshore, creating an offshore bar that reduces wave energy, allowing the dunes time to recover\n\nPositive feedback mechanisms can lead to disequilibrium in the coastal system\n\nIncreasing storiminess could lead to long term erosion of sand dunes with no chance to recover between events\n\n\n\n\n2.2.7 Weathering Processes\n\nWeathering is the break down of rocks in situ. It does not involved movement (unlike erosion)\nWeathering processes can be physical, chemical or biological.\nThey can operate between the low tide level and the cliffs or land of the backshore.\nClimate plays an important role as it dictates temperature and moisture levels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nProcesses\n\n\nMechanical/Physical\nBreak down of rocks due the exertion of a physical force\nFreeze-Thaw weathering\nOccurs on coasts were the temperatures changes daily above and below zero\nWater seeps into joints and cracks in the rock and when it freezes expands, exerting pressure and forcing the rock apart\nWater expands by 9% in volume when freezing\n\n\nChemical\nWeathering involves a chemical reaction and the generation of a new chemical compound\nOxidation\nOxygen combines with iron based minerals in a rock, causing a chemical breakdown of the minerals\n\n\n\nCarbonation\nDissolving of carbonate rocks due to acidic rain producing calcium bicarbonate in solution\nLimestone is specially vulnerable\n\n\nBiological\nPlants bacteria or animals accelerate chemical or physical weathering\nBoring molluscs\nMolluscs live on coastal rocks, scraping away at the rock surface to get food or boring a hole in the rock to make a home\nThey can also secrete chemicals that dissolve rocks\n\n\nPlant roots\nTrees and plant roots can grow in cracks and fissures forcing rocks apart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.8 Mass Movement\nMass movement is the movement downslope of rocks, sand, clay or soil.\n\nBlock Falls\n\nOccur on steep slopes as a cliff face is weathered which loosens blocks and when wave erosion creates a wave cut notch, the overhang is no longer supported.\n\nRock fragments fall to the base of the slope and form talus scree slopes\n\n\nRotational Slumping\n\nOccurs in unconsolidated sands and clays where a section of the cliff remains intact as it moves down a cliff along a curved cliff plane\n\nPermeable strata sits on top of impermeable strata allowing rainwater to percolate saturating the permeable sands, loading the cliff material\nWater is forced to move along the sand as the clay is impermeable creating a high pore water pressure in the sand and creates internal pressure within the cliff\nThe curved failure surface develop in the sand and teh whole life rotates about a pivot point\nThis leaves a crescent shaped rotational scar about it on the cliff\nA sequence of slumps will creates benches or a terraced cliff profile\n\n\nLandslides\n\nWeak rock s such as clay or unconsolidated sands can become saturated, lose their cohesion and flow downslope.\n\nHeavy rainfall and high tides can contribute to saturation"

When ice sheets melt at the end of an ice age, the landstarts to rebound back upwards. The US is still showing isostatic readjustment with Scotland rising and Southern and Eastern England sinking.\nAs tectonic plates move and collide, some continental shelves and areas of land are pushed upwards. Other areas may sink. Volcanic islands may form new coastlines such as island arcs, or hotspot locations.\nMarine regression - seabed is exposed as the sea level drops, producing an emergent coast\nMarine transgression - areas of land flood, producing a submergent coast\nEmergent Coastline - result of isostatic rebound.\n\nRaised Beaches\n\nFormer beach now above the high tideline. \nThey have several wave cut platforms as sea levels change frequently\n\nFossil Cliffs\n\nNear vertical slope formed by marine processes but now some distance inland\n\n\nSubmergent Coastline -  caused by sea level rise or isostatic sinking\n\nRias\n\nFlooded river valley.\nDuring an ice age, some land areas were not covered with ice but had frozen grounds so rivers carved valleys with steeper sides than normal\nAs the ice melted, sea level rose and drowned the mouth of these valleys\n\nFjords\n\nFlooded glaciated valley\nGlaciers eroded U shaped valleys down to the coast of the time, and after the ice melted, sea level rose again and flooded into the valley over a shallow threshold, creating a deep water inlet with steep sides\n\nDalmatian\n\nTectonic activity leads to folding of the ground, leaving anticlines and synclines. The synclines are flooded with long islands between them.\n\n\nContemporary Sea Level rise\n\nSea levels are rising due to climate change.\nThe current rate of rise is about 2 mm a year\nLow lying islands such as the Maldives may disappear, along with coastal ecosystems\n\nSea level is difficult to predict for the following reasons\n\nThermal expansion of the oceans as they warm due to global warming ; the contribution depends on how global temperatures climb\nThe melting of mountain glaciers in the Alps, Himalayas etc will increase ocean water volume\nThere is uncertainty about when and how much ice sheets such as Greenland and Antarctic will melt.\n\n\n\nIn some areas, sea level can change locally due to tectonic activity.\nSuccessive major earthquakes have repeatedly lifted the shoreline by several meters in Wellington, New Zealand \nDuring the 2004 Indian OCean tsunami, the coastline on Sumatra dropped by 1m!\n\nCoastal Recession is affected by physical and human factors\n\nCoastal retreat may be influenced by natural factors such as the lithology, margarine process and subaerial processes.\nOffshore dredging may increase coastal retreat. Dredging refers to the removal of sand for construction purposes to deepen entrances to ports or to supply sediments for beach nourishment\nDeeper waves allow waves to maintain their circular motion and energy closer inshore and have a more destructive impact on the coast. \n\nDredging can remove species and communities, increasing suspended sediment levels which can damage coral reefs\n\nStarvation of sediment elsewhere may result due to the construction of gyrones that interrupt longshore drift and trap sediment, but leads to greater erosion elsewhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase study: The Nile Delta Case Study\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple human activities can be found concentrated across the 240km  coast of the Nile Delta\nThere are holiday beach resorts, coastal defences, tourism, marine recreational, fisheries, land reclamation, agriculture and port infrastructure\nThe coastline is experiencing retreat, with significant erosion on half of it.\nCoastal flooding is becoming more frequent due to climate change.\nAs sea levels rise and offshore bars are eroded, 3.3% of the delta land area will be lost\nIf sea levels rise by 1 m, 2 million hectares of fertile land will be lost and at least 6 million people will be displaced\nThe construction of the Aswan High Dam, decreased the sediment volume as the sediment was trapped by the reservoir and dam. Consequently, erosion rates increased from 20 m per year to 200m per year as the delta was starved of sediment\n\n\n\n\nRates of recession are not constant and can be influenced by long and short term factors\n\nHighest levels of retreat occurs with \n\nWeakly consolidated rocks\nLong wave fetch and large destructive waves.\n\nCoasts with long fetches are more likely to retreat faster than those with shorter fetches\nAt the holderness coastline, the dominant winds have a large fetch as they travel across the North Sea. Though rare, when they do occur erosion rates amy reach over 8m a year\nIn the Southwest, the winds come from the Atlantic\n\nCliffs with structural weakness such as faults\nWeather Systems\n\nIn winter, the temperate difference between the equator and the pole is at its greatest, which means the depressions are at their strongest, with lower air pressure and faster wind speeds, which creates largest destructive waves and the fastest recession rates\n\nTides\n\nExtreme high tides known as spring tides occur when the Sun and the moon aligned so that their gravitational pull is at its strongest\nTides are important because they determine  where the waves will reach the shore. At high tides, waves are more likely to reach the backshore and erode the land faster.\n\nMass movement and constant weathering processes\n\nWeathering weakens the rock found at the coast and allows erosion rates to increase.\nMass movement moves sediment away at the base of coastal slopes where wave action and longshore drift can carry material away. This then exposes the base of coastal slopes resulting in cliffs retreating further.\n\n\nThere are variations are retreat level in the Holderness Coast, with an average annual erosion of 1.25m a year - but with a wide range from 0 m to 6m. The geology is consistent (boulder clay) so the variations are due to:\n\nCoastal defences in locations have decreased erosion\nStarvation of sediment further south due to construction of groynes has interrupted longshore drift but led to to greater erosion just south of the defense\nMass movement susceptibility in some locations \nWinter storms cause more erosion, especially when they coincide with a high spring tide\nStorms are more rare in summer months so erosion rates are lower\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Coastal flood risk\nLocal factors\n\nFor most people at coastlines, the threat of flooding outweighs the treaty of erosion. Many people who live on low lying coasts are only a few meters above sea level\nEcosystems such as mangrove forests are important for reducing flood risk so their removal can increase risk significantly.\n\nMangroves reduce the height of waves by 40%, reducing wave erosion and distance reached inland\nStabilize sediment, trapping and adding to them so keeping the level of coastal land higher\nIn Indonesia, coastline treated due to flooding when mangroves were removed\n\nSea level rise of 40 cm in the Bay of Bengal would submerge 11% of Bangladesh coastland, resulting in 7-10 million environmental refugees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase study: Maldives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation: 340000\nHighest point in the country is only 2.3m above sea level\nA sea level rise of 50cm by 2100 could mean the Maldives lose 77% of its land area become flooded\nMale, the capital, now has a 3m high sea wall\n\n\n\n\nStorm surges\n\nMost short term coastal flooding is a result of storm surges\nStorm surge is a short term change in sea level caused by low air pressure. This is because as air pressure drops, the weight of the air pressing down on the sea surface drops, so the sea surface rises.\nThis can be:\n\nA depression (low pressure water system in the mid latitudes)\nA tropical cyclone (low air pressure and strong winds)\n\nA fall in air pressure of 1mb leads to a 1cm rise in local sea level rise.\nSevere depression or cyclone can make coastal flooding worse as\n\nStrong winds push waves onshore so wave height increases\nHigh or spring tides occur at the same time of the storm, making the sea level even higher than normal\nIf the shape of a coastline is confined and funneled into an area of shallow offshore water, then the situation worsens. \n\nThe 2013 North Sea storm surge was particularly hazardous because :\n\nThere were winds of over 140 mph\nGale force northerly winds drove the storm waves resulting in a storm surge of 5.8m\nSurge corresponded with high tide in many locations, making flooding even worse\n\nIt resulted in: significant coastal flooding in Hull, 100000 home lost power in Scotland, 1400 properties were flooded\n\n\nStorm surges in Bangladesh\n\nTropical cyclones have lower air pressure and stronger winds resulting in larger storm surge heights\nBangladesh is particularly vulnerable as:\n\nMuch of the country is low lying 1-3m\nIncoming storm surges meet outflowing river discharge from the Ganges, meaning river flooding and coastal flooding combine\nIntense rainfall from tropical cyclones contribute to flooding\nDeforestation of coastal mangrove forests have removed vegetation that used to stabilise coastal swamps and dissipate wave energy\nTriangular shape of the Bay of Bengal concentrates a cyclone storm surge as it moves north, increasing its height with it makes landfall\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Climate Change and coastal flooding\n\nSea levels are rising due to global warming.\nIt is predicted that depression and cyclones will have more energy and be stronger, with faster wind and lower air pressure (though the evidence is weak)\nIt is important to state that depression, cyclones and storm surges have always happened and would continue to happen without global warming and rising sea levels.\nData on average wind speeds and wave heights is too poor to make accurate future forecast, compared to data on sea level.\nCoasts are very complex systems which are affected by many factors. Blaming coastal flooding on just global warming misunderstands the interplay of factors that affect the level of risk on coasts"

This is because it’s not a risk, but a certainty\n\nHowever, the DEFRA provided East Riding COuncil with £1.2 million as one of 15 UK Coastal Change pathfinders projects.They money was spent assisting 43 homeowners with relocation and demolition expenses\n\nSocial costs include losing friends and family, having to relocate, lose of jobs, losses of amenity areas linked to tourism and recreation or of aesthetic values\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Impacts of coastal flooding at a developed and developing country\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUK 2013 Storm\nBangladesh Floods\n\n\nCause\n\nVery deep depression named Cyclone

and farms\n\n\n15000 deaths\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Climate change and environmental refugees\n\nMost at risk are islands such as Maldives, Tuvalu and Kiribati which have particular risk factors:\n\n80% of people in the Seychelles live and work at the coast\nMAny are fringed by coral reefs (which act as a natural coastal defence against erosion) but rising ocean temperatures due to global warming risk reef destruction \nThey have small narrow economies based almost entirely on tourism or primary industry such as fishing, which can be easily disrupted\n\nIn New Zealand, 75 citizens of Kiribati, 75 citizens of Tuvalu and 250 citizens of Tonga have been granted residency status in the country each year\nIt is projected that if climate change results in sea levels rising by 50cm, then 11% of Bangladesh’s coastal land maybe flooded resulting in 7-10 million environmental refugees\n\n\n\n2.4.4 Hard Engineering Projects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nHow it works\nAdvantage\nDisadvantage\n\n\nGroynes\nWooden walls on a beach at right angles to the coast to slow down longshore drift\n They made the beach wider and higher so the waves expend their energy on it rather than on the backshore\n\nIncreases the recreational amenity value, assisting tourism\n\n\nExpensive (£1000pm)\n May be an obstacle to some people\n Considered ugly and are not natural\n May increase erosion downdrift\n\n\n\nSea Wall\n\nCurved structures parallel to the backshore\nCurvature aims to reduce the wave energy\n\n\nMade of long lasting concrete\nPrevent high water levels from moving inland\n\n\nVery expensive (£5000pm)\nMay be considered ugly, decreasing amenity value\nReduce the supply of sediment which may affect coastal areas nearby\n\n\n\nRip Rap\n\nBoulders (usually granite) resistant to erosion and with a large surface area to break up waves, dissipating their energy\n\n\nLong lasting and flexible\n\n\n\nCost about £50 per m3\nCan create access difficulties as they are dangerous to climb over\nSome weathering and erosion may still occur at the backshore as seawater may still move through it\n\n\n\nRevetments\n\nSloped walls, often made of wood, placed parallel to the backshore\nTake the force of breaking water, weakening their erosive strength and protecting the backshore\n\n\nLongshore drift process can still continue\nCheaper alternative to sea walls\n\n\nStill expensive at £1500pm\nLook unsightly\nMay need constant maintenance if the wood is abraded by powerful waves\n\n\n\nOffshore breakwaters\n\nRock boulders usually granite dropped and aligned in short lengths in shallow nearshore waters parallel to the shore\nThey absorb wave energy and dissipate the waves before they can erode the foreshore or backshore\n\n\nBeing offshore, they allow longshore drift to still occur\nKeeps the amenity value as they create sheltered water for water sports as well as keeping a beach in place for recreational and tourist use\n\n\nExpensive - £2000pm\nMay look unsightly at low tide\nCreate increased deposition in the landward side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.5 Soft Engineering Projects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nHow it works\nAdvantage\nDisadvantage\n\n\nBeach nourishment\n\nReplaces the lost sediment that may have been eroded or transported by longshore drift\nA large beach will absorb wave energy and protect the backshore from erosion\n\n\nLooks natural and more sightly\nProduces an amenity for recreation\n\n\nCosts about £10 per m3 or £2 million per km\nDoes not last long, especially during winter so needs to be repeated frequently\nDisrupts the natural sediment cell\n\n\n\nCliff regrading and drainage\n\nThe cliff is artificially cut to a stable angle\nTo reduce mass movement, cliffs are drained with gravels so that the cliffs can drain water out quickly\n\n\nCreates a natural looking slope\nLooks natural once completed as its not visible\nReduces mass movement\n\n\nCosts about £1 million\nSome land and property may be lost as the slope angle is changed\nDifficult to implement along the whole of cliff without disturbance\n\n\n\n\nDune stabilisation\n\nMonitor the condition of dunes and repair them with a geofabric or replanting of grasses (e.g. marram grass) together with the infilling of slacks.\n\n\nLooks natural\nEffective barrier to higher sea levels and tides\n\n\nMay not be able to withstand the effects of a very powerful storm\n£10pm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.6 Sustainable coastal management\nMany coastal communities in the 21st century face:\nRising global sea levels but uncertainty about the scale and timing of the rise\nIncreased frequency of storms and the possibility of increased erosion and flooding\n\nSustainable coastal management refers to managing the wider coastal zone in terms of people and their economic livelihoods, social and cultural wellbeing and safety from coastal hazards, as well as minimising environmental impacts\n\nManage natural resources (e.g. fish) to ensure long term productivity\nManage flood and erosion risk, relocating to safe areas\nEducating communities to understand why change is needed and how to adapt\n\nIn the Maldives, there has been a potential for conflict to occur as coastal management has focused on some areas (such as Male the capital, whilst ignoring isolated islands) as well as traditional income sources (e.g. fishing) and resources (e.g. mangroves) are being overlooked in favour of tourism development\n\nThe Japanese Government has funded mangrove nurseries on the Maldives so that damaged mangrove areas can be replanted\n\n\n\n\n2.4.7 Integrated Coastal Zone Management\n\nThe entire coastal zone is managed, not just the narrow zone where breaking waves cause erosion or flooding, including all ecosystems and human activity in the zone.\nICZM aims to bring together economic decision maker s(e..g tourism, fishing and ports) nad different government levels, emphasising the cooperation between all stakeholders so that everyone benefits\nAims to conserve the coastal ecosystem ensuring that future generations can use the coast\nAim to work with natural processes not against them\n\n\n\n2.4.8 Shoreline management plans\n\nIn 1993, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food set out a national strategy for flood and coastal defence in England and Wales based on the 11 natural sediment (literal) cells and subcells.\nCoastlines are measure on these principles: \n\nEnvironmentally acceptable protection measures\nEconomically viable coastal defences (considering land use, property values)\nLong term sustainability of natural coastal processes and ecosystems\nMaintenance of repair costs\n\nThere are four main policies\n\nHold the line (maintaining existing defences and building new defences)\nAdvance the line (intervention through the buildings of new defenses seaward side)\nManaged realignment (monitoring and managing natural processes in certain places where necessary)\nNo active management (doing nothing with no investment or maintenance of existing defences)\n\nProperty values can change depending on the the proposed action that comes through a Cost Benefit Analysis which compares the cost of coastal defenses against the value of the land to be protected.\nEnvironmental Impact  Assessment is a key part of the decision making process.\nIt identifies the positives and negatives of a development or scheme before it is implemented and feedback can be used to make improvements and modifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase study: Happisburgh, North Norfolk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHappisburgh failed to qualify for the governments grants for coastal defences. \nManaged retreat was operated, much to the disappointment of locals, especially the residents of Beach Road who one by one, have lost their homes to the sea.\nBy 2105, the shoreline may recede by 200m, with property losses totally £6 million\nHouse values are very low and people cannot afford to move elsewhere, having invested in buying a house that at the time was some distance away from the eroding cliff.\nCCAG raised awareness of the coastal erosion issue both locally and nationally.\nThe campaign culminated in the launch of the Pathfinder pilot project in 2009.\n\nThe pathfinder project meant a government allocation of £3 million for 6 settlements, including Happisburgh\n£1.4 million was set aside for purchase and leaseback of 11 houses on Beach Road. Owners were given half the value of their home, giving people a chance to relocate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase study: Chittagong, Bangladesh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoastal Climate Resilient Infrastructure Project (2012) supported by the Asian Development Bank aimed to climate proof the area\n\nRoad connects were improved (for farmers and markets) \nRaised embankments to 60 cm above normal flood levels, making them more resistant to coastal erosion\nCreating new market areas with sheds raised on platforms above thee expected 2050 sea level\nConstructive 25 cyclone shelters that could withstand strong earthquakes and 260 km/hr winds\nTraining in climate resilience and adaptation measures\n\nThe positive on the project included elevating poverty (up to 10%) by generating income opportunities, adapting to climate change\nNegatives included removal of natural vegetation and relocation of 200 people."
