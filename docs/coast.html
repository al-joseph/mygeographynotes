<ul>
<li><p>This is the area between the land and the sea, stretching out into the sea and onto the shore.</p></li>
<li><p>The zone is subdivided into the backshore, foreshore, nearshore and offshore</p></li>
<li><p>The backshore is only affected by waves during high tides (often called spring tides) and during major storms. It is above sea level. This is where mass movement and weathering occurs</p></li>
<li><p>The nearshore refers to shallow water close to land. It is very there is most human activity, such as fishing and and leisure</p></li>
<li><p>Waves processes normally occur between the high and low tide mark. Erosion and deposition occur at the foreshore and nearshore.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The zone is in dynamic equilibrium due to the wide range of natural processes that interact within it These process can be short term (individual waves, tides etc) or long term (climate change)</p>

<p>The shape of a coastline is largely determined by geology and wave action.</p>
<p>Concordant Coastline (Pacific coasts)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Rock types lie in the same direction as the coastline - e.g.&nbsp;in South Dorset made from purbeck limestone, mudstone, greensand etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Dalmatian Coastlines</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The geology of Dalmatia is limestone,&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>It has been folded by tectonic activity into a series of anticlines and synclines that trend parallel to the moden coastline</p></li>
<li><p>These basins have been drowned by rising sea levels of create a concordant coastline of long, narrow islands arranged in lines offshore</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Haff Coastline</p>
<ul>
<li>Long sediment ridges topped by sand dunes run parallel to the coast just offshore, creating lagoons (haffs) between the ridge and the shore</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Discordant Coastline (Atlantic Coasts)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Rock types is perpendicular to the coast</p></li>
<li><p>Alternating bands of hard and soft rock create headlands where there is more resistant rock (or an upfold) and bays (downfalls) where there is less resistant rock</p></li>
<li><p>Bays have semicircular shapes; as the waves enter the bay, the waves dissipate, lose energy and deposit a bay head beach.</p></li>
<li><p>Headlands protrude out into the sea</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The shape of a coastline causes wave to refract as they approach the headlands</p></li>
<li><p>As waves approach the shallower water offshore a headland, they slow down and wave height increases</p></li>
<li><p>and this concentrates the waves energy on a headland.&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>E.g. on the East Dorset Coastline, a bay has formed called Swanage Bay as the mudstone has eroded quicker than the purbeck limestone and and chalk, leading to headlands e.g.&nbsp;studland head</p></li>

<h3 data-number="2.1.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="coastal-geomorphology"><span class="header-section-number">2.1.5</span> Coastal Geomorphology</h3>
<p>Geological structures can influence on coastal morphology and erosion rates</p>
<p><br>
Cliff profiles are influenced by different aspects of geology, namely<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The resistance erosion of the rock</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are two main cliff profile types: maine erosion dominated or subaerial process dominated</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At maine erosion dominated cliffs, wave action dominates, cliffs tend to be steep. There is little in the way of rock debris at the base of the cliff as its quickly broken up by erosion and carried away by waves</p></li>
<li><p>At subaerial dominated cliffs, mass movement and surface runoff erosion dominates. They slowly move rock and sediment downslope by the limited marine wave erosion means it’s not removed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The dip of rock strata in relation to the coastline</p></li>
<li><p>The dip simply refers to the angle of the rock strata in relation to the horizontal</p></li>
<li><p>The angle can be tilted by tectonic activity</p></li>
<li><p>There are four main types:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Horizontal - vertical profile with notches reflect strata that are more easily eroded</p></li>
<li><p>Seaward dip, high angle - one rock layer faces the sea</p></li>
<li><p>Seaward dip low angle - profile may exceed 90 degrees producing areas of overhanging rock, very vulnerable to rock falls</p></li>
<li><p>Landward dip - Very stable cliff with reduced rock falls</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Faults represent weaknesses within rock layers. They are major fractures due to tectonic activity. Either side of a fault tines, rocks are fractures and broken and these weakness can be exploited by marine erosion</p>
<p>Joints occur at the division of rock strata up into blocks with a regular shape</p>
<p>Fissures are smaller cracks in rocks, often a few cm or mm long but the represent weakness that erosion can exploit</p>
<p>Caves and wave cut notches occur at the location of faults, and or strata which have a high density of joints and fissures.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Regular patterns of joining in rocks are often a result of sedimentary rocks being folded by tectonic forces.</p></li>
<li><p>Folding occurs due to crustal compression. When horizontal stars are squeezed they can be folded into a series of anticlines and synclines.&nbsp;</p></li>

<li><p>E.g. Granite; basalt</p></li>
<li><p>Very slow erosion rate</p></li>
<li><p>Igneous rocks are crystalline - i.e.&nbsp;the interlocking crystals make for strong hard erosion- resistant rock</p></li>
<li><p>There are few joints (e.g.&nbsp;granite) so there are limited weaknesses than erosion can exploit</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Metamorphic</p>
<ul>
<li><p>E..g marble</p></li>
<li><p>Slow erosion rate</p></li>
<li><p>Crystalline metamorphic rock are resistant to erosion</p></li>
<li><p>However, sometimes the crystals are oriented in one direction, producing weaknesses - called foliation</p></li>
<li><p>Metamorphic rocks are often folded and heavily fractured which are weaknesses the erosion can exploit</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Sedimentary</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sandstone; limestone</p></li>
<li><p>Moderate to fast</p></li>
<li><p>Tend to be clastic - i.e.&nbsp;made of cemented sediment particles</p></li>
<li><p>The age of sedimentary rock is important as geologically young rocks tend to be weaker</p></li>
<li><p>Rocks with many fractures, such as shale are often most vulnerable to erosion</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The weakest coastal material is unconsolidated sediment. E..g sand, gravel clay, that have not been compacted or cemented to become sedimentary rock. It is loose and easily eroded</p>
<p>Permeability</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Permeable rocks allow water to flow through them - e.g sandstone, limestone</p></li>
<li><p>Impermeable rocks do not allow water to flow through them including most igneous and metamorphic rocks</p></li>
<li><p>This is important as water can remove the cement that holds the rock together</p></li>
<li><p>It can also create high pore water pressure within cliffs, affecting their stability (leads to rotational slumping)</p></li>
<li><p>Some type of rock contain soluble minerals, and so are vulnerable to chemical weathering such as carbonation or hydrolysis</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The role of vegetation at the coast</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ecosystems at the coast include coral reefs, mangrove forests, salt marshes and sand dunes</p></li>
<li><p>Salt marshes and sand dunes are the most common in lowland UK areas</p></li>
<li><p>Most plants that grow in coastal environments are:</p></li>
<li><p>Halophytes - tolerate salt water</p></li>
<li><p>Xerophytes - Tolerate very dry conditions</p></li>
<li><p>Salt Marshes successional development in eustraline areas</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Common in low energy environments of estuaries and sheltered bays</p></li>
<li><p>The river brings in fine muds and silts, depositing them at the sides of the estuaries whilst the tidal conditions bring seawater in and out</p></li>
<li><p>The tiny clay particles stick to each other, in a process called flocculation, and once deposited they are colonised by algae</p></li>
<li><p>Over time, the plants trap more sediment which builds up the salt mash up to a higher level so that other plants can then colonise.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Sand dunes successional development on sandy coastlines</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Form when there is plentiful supply of sand, a large area of the sand to dry out, strong onshore winds to blow the sand towards the land and an obstacle such as vegetation to trap the sand.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Embryo dunes form first and once established collect more sand and become larger</p></li>
<li><p>Pioneer plants (eg sea rocket) colonse the stable dunes and help hold the sand together and trap more sand</p></li>
<li><p>Yellow dunes are highest and are colonised by marram grass.</p></li>
<li><p>Slacks form (dips in the succession) due to periods of wind erosions</p></li>
<li><p>At high tide, seawater may reach the dips in the sand dunes, called slacks, allowing other plants such as marsh orchids to grow here.</p></li>
<li><p>Mature dunes (also known as grey dunes) contain high humus content.</p></li>
<li><p>The oldest dunes are closest to the land - the climax vegetation is either pine forests or oak forests</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>How does vegetation stabilise sediment?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Roots of the sediment help bind particles together, making them harder to erode</p></li>
<li><p>Plants act as&nbsp; protective layer so the surface of the sediment is not directly exposed to move water and thus erosion</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce wind speed at the surface due to friction&nbsp; with the vegetation, reducing wind erosion</p></li>

<p>As waves approach a shoreline, the internal orbital motion of water touches the seabed, causing friction between the wave and the seabed, slowing down the wave. ITs wavelength decreases and wave height increases. It breaks in shallow water as the crest of the wave begins to move forward much faster than the trough as the trough experiences more friction with the sediment and the rock of the shore. The crest outruns the trough and the wave topples forward</p>

<p>Erosional Processes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Corrasion - or abrasion occurs when the sediment picked up by waves is thrown against the cliff face. This chisels away the surface and gradually wears it down as it abrades (or scratches) the rock.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Loose sediment has to be available (for example shingle, or pebbles)</p></li>
<li><p>Softer sedimentary rocks are more vulnerable than hard igneous rocks</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Attrition - When boulders, rock particles, pebbles are continually moved around the waves, they collide with each other. The numerous collisions between particles slowly chip fragments of the sediment. The sediment becomes smoother, smaller and more rounded over time</p>
<ul>
<li>Process is faster with softer rocks</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Solution - or corrosion occurs when carbonate rocks are vulnerable to solution by rainwater, spray from the sea or seawater&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Mainly affects limestone, which is vulnerable to solution by weak acids</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Hydraulic Action - Air trapped in cracks and fissures is compressed by the force of destructive waves crashing against the cliff face. As the wave retreats, pressure forces the crack open. This process dislodges blocks of rock from the cliff face</p>
<ul>
<li>Highly jointed/fissured sedimentary rocks are very vulnerable</li>

<li><p>A curved, wave cut notch forms</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Wave cut platforms</p>
<ul>
<li><p>As the cliff is eroded at the base, the rock above is left unsupported leaving an overhang. This collapses under the influence of gravity.</p></li>
<li><p>As the cliff retreats, a wave cut platform is left behind between the high and low tide levels.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Cliffs</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cliffs are vertical slopes caused by waves undercutting the land at high tide.</p></li>
<li><p>As the cliffs are undercut, gravity is able to cause mass movement in the unsupported rock</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Cave- Arch- stack-stump sequence</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At a headland waves will be refracted so that the full energy of erosion is concentrated on weakness on the sides</p></li>
<li><p>Hydraulic action and corrasion will form a cave. E.g. Tilly Whim Cave</p></li>
<li><p>When these meet from opposite sides, a tunnel is formed called a rock arch - e.g Durdle Door</p></li>
<li><p>Eventually the top becomes unstable, and collapses, leaving a pillar of rock called a stack. E.g. Old Harry Rock</p></li>
<li><p>WAves can continue to erode the base of a stack (especially during storm conditions) cutting notches in several sides.</p></li>
<li><p>The stack becomes unstable and collapses, leaving just the base called a stump e.g Old Harry’s Wife</p></li>
<li><p>Waves, tides and currents can transport sediment. For example rip currents, transport sediment from the foreshore to nearshore areas</p></li>
<li><p>Tide also determines what height on the foreshore&nbsp; or backfshore these processes may be operating.</p></li>

<p>Plant succession is very important as they bind the loose sediment together and encourage further deposition. Sand dunes stabilize the sediment landward of the beach. Depositional landforms are thus vulnerable when their generation is damaged. This happens due to overgrazing or trampling from tourism and leisure activities</p>

<li><p>Coastal retreat may be influenced by natural factors such as the lithology, margarine process and subaerial processes.</p></li>
<li><p>Offshore dredging may increase coastal retreat. Dredging refers to the removal of sand for construction purposes to deepen entrances to ports or to supply sediments for beach nourishment</p></li>
<li><p>Deeper waves allow waves to maintain their circular motion and energy closer inshore and have a more destructive impact on the coast.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Dredging can remove species and communities, increasing suspended sediment levels which can damage coral reefs</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Starvation of sediment elsewhere may result due to the construction of gyrones that interrupt longshore drift and trap sediment, but leads to greater erosion elsewhere</p></li>

<li><p>Multiple human activities can be found concentrated across the 240km&nbsp; coast of the Nile Delta</p></li>
<li><p>There are holiday beach resorts, coastal defences, tourism, marine recreational, fisheries, land reclamation, agriculture and port infrastructure</p></li>
<li><p>The coastline is experiencing retreat, with significant erosion on half of it.</p></li>
<li><p>Coastal flooding is becoming more frequent due to climate change.</p></li>
<li><p>As sea levels rise and offshore bars are eroded, 3.3% of the delta land area will be lost</p></li>
<li><p>If sea levels rise by 1 m, 2 million hectares of fertile land will be lost and at least 6 million people will be displaced</p></li>
<li><p>The construction of the Aswan High Dam, decreased the sediment volume as the sediment was trapped by the reservoir and dam. Consequently, erosion rates increased from 20 m per year to 200m per year as the delta was starved of sediment</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Rates of recession are not constant and can be influenced by long and short term factors</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Highest levels of retreat occurs with&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Weakly consolidated rocks</p></li>
<li><p>Long wave fetch and large destructive waves.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Coasts with long fetches are more likely to retreat faster than those with shorter fetches</p></li>
<li><p>At the holderness coastline, the dominant winds have a large fetch as they travel across the North Sea. Though rare, when they do occur erosion rates amy reach over 8m a year</p></li>
<li><p>In the Southwest, the winds come from the Atlantic</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Cliffs with structural weakness such as faults</p></li>
<li><p>Weather Systems</p>
<ul>
<li>In winter, the temperate difference between the equator and the pole is at its greatest, which means the depressions are at their strongest, with lower air pressure and faster wind speeds, which creates largest destructive waves and the fastest recession rates</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Tides</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Extreme high tides known as spring tides occur when the Sun and the moon aligned so that their gravitational pull is at its strongest</p></li>
<li><p>Tides are important because they determine&nbsp; where the waves will reach the shore. At high tides, waves are more likely to reach the backshore and erode the land faster.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Mass movement and constant weathering processes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Weathering weakens the rock found at the coast and allows erosion rates to increase.</p></li>
<li><p>Mass movement moves sediment away at the base of coastal slopes where wave action and longshore drift can carry material away. This then exposes the base of coastal slopes resulting in cliffs retreating further.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>There are variations are retreat level in the Holderness Coast, with an average annual erosion of 1.25m a year - but with a wide range from 0 m to 6m. The geology is consistent (boulder clay) so the variations are due to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Coastal defences in locations have decreased erosion</p></li>
<li><p>Starvation of sediment further south due to construction of groynes has interrupted longshore drift but led to to greater erosion just south of the defense</p></li>
<li><p>Mass movement susceptibility in some locations&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Winter storms cause more erosion, especially when they coincide with a high spring tide</p></li>
<li><p>Storms are more rare in summer months so erosion rates are lower</p></li>

<p>Local factors</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For most people at coastlines, the threat of flooding outweighs the treaty of erosion. Many people who live on low lying coasts are only a few meters above sea level</p></li>
<li><p>Ecosystems such as mangrove forests are important for reducing flood risk so their removal can increase risk significantly.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mangroves reduce the height of waves by 40%, reducing wave erosion and distance reached inland</p></li>
<li><p>Stabilize sediment, trapping and adding to them so keeping the level of coastal land higher</p></li>
<li><p>In Indonesia, coastline treated due to flooding when mangroves were removed</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Sea level rise of 40 cm in the Bay of Bengal would submerge 11% of Bangladesh coastland, resulting in 7-10 million environmental refugees.</p></li>

<p><strong>Storm surges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Most short term coastal flooding is a result of storm surges</p></li>
<li><p>Storm surge is a short term change in sea level caused by low air pressure. This is because as air pressure drops, the weight of the air pressing down on the sea surface drops, so the sea surface rises.</p></li>
<li><p>This can be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A depression (low pressure water system in the mid latitudes)</p></li>
<li><p>A tropical cyclone (low air pressure and strong winds)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A fall in air pressure of 1mb leads to a 1cm rise in local sea level rise.</p></li>
<li><p>Severe depression or cyclone can make coastal flooding worse as</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Strong winds push waves onshore so wave height increases</p></li>
<li><p>High or spring tides occur at the same time of the storm, making the sea level even higher than normal</p></li>
<li><p>If the shape of a coastline is confined and funneled into an area of shallow offshore water, then the situation worsens.&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The 2013 North Sea storm surge was particularly hazardous because :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There were winds of over 140 mph</p></li>
<li><p>Gale force northerly winds drove the storm waves resulting in a storm surge of 5.8m</p></li>
<li><p>Surge corresponded with high tide in many locations, making flooding even worse</p>
<ul>
<li>It resulted in: significant coastal flooding in Hull, 100000 home lost power in Scotland, 1400 properties were flooded</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Storm surges in Bangladesh</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tropical cyclones have lower air pressure and stronger winds resulting in larger storm surge heights</p></li>
<li><p>Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Much of the country is low lying 1-3m</p></li>
<li><p>Incoming storm surges meet outflowing river discharge from the Ganges, meaning river flooding and coastal flooding combine</p></li>
<li><p>Intense rainfall from tropical cyclones contribute to flooding</p></li>
<li><p>Deforestation of coastal mangrove forests have removed vegetation that used to stabilise coastal swamps and dissipate wave energy</p></li>
<li><p>Triangular shape of the Bay of Bengal concentrates a cyclone storm surge as it moves north, increasing its height with it makes landfall</p></li>

<li><p>Sea levels are rising due to global warming.</p></li>
<li><p>It is predicted that depression and cyclones will have more energy and be stronger, with faster wind and lower air pressure (though the evidence is weak)</p></li>
<li><p>It is important to state that depression, cyclones and storm surges have always happened and would continue to happen without global warming and rising sea levels.</p></li>
<li><p>Data on average wind speeds and wave heights is too poor to make accurate future forecast, compared to data on sea level.</p></li>

<li><p>Happisburgh failed to qualify for the governments grants for coastal defences.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Managed retreat was operated, much to the disappointment of locals, especially the residents of Beach Road who one by one, have lost their homes to the sea.</p></li>
<li><p>By 2105, the shoreline may recede by 200m, with property losses totally £6 million</p></li>
<li><p>House values are very low and people cannot afford to move elsewhere, having invested in buying a house that at the time was some distance away from the eroding cliff.</p></li>
<li><p>CCAG raised awareness of the coastal erosion issue both locally and nationally.</p></li>
<li><p>The campaign culminated in the launch of the Pathfinder pilot project in 2009.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The pathfinder project meant a government allocation of £3 million for 6 settlements, including Happisburgh</p></li>
<li><p>£1.4 million was set aside for purchase and leaseback of 11 houses on Beach Road. Owners were given half the value of their home, giving people a chance to relocate</p></li>

<li><p>Coastal Climate Resilient Infrastructure Project (2012) supported by the Asian Development Bank aimed to climate proof the area</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Road connects were improved (for farmers and markets)&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Raised embankments to 60 cm above normal flood levels, making them more resistant to coastal erosion</p></li>
<li><p>Creating new market areas with sheds raised on platforms above thee expected 2050 sea level</p></li>
<li><p>Constructive 25 cyclone shelters that could withstand strong earthquakes and 260 km/hr winds</p></li>
<li><p>Training in climate resilience and adaptation measures</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The positive on the project included elevating poverty (up to 10%) by generating income opportunities, adapting to climate change</p></li>
<li><p>Negatives included removal of natural vegetation and relocation of 200 people.</p></li>
